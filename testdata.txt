album-oriented rock sometimes referred to as adult-oriented rock or as west coast rock abbreviated aor and originally called album-oriented radio was originally an american fm radio format focusing on album tracks by rock artists
this format developed and popularised the repertoire of music currently associated with classic rock
history
freeform and progressive
the roots of the album oriented rock aor radio format began with programming concepts rooted in 1960s idealism
the freeform or progressive formats developed the repertoire and set the tone that would dominate aor playlists for much of its heyday
in the mid to late 1960s the fcc enacted a non-duplication rule prohibiting fm radio stations from merely running a simulcast of the programming from their am counterparts
owners of am fm combo stations fought these new regulations vigorously delaying the new rules for eighteen months
when finally enacted station owners were pressed to come up with alternate programming options quickly
the freeform format in commercial radio was born out of this desperate need to program the fm airwaves inexpensively
programmers like tom donahue at kmpx developed stations where djs had freedom to play long sets of music often covering a variety of genres
songs were not limited to hits or singles indeed the djs often played obscure or longer tracks by newer or more adventurous artists than heard on top 40 stations of the day
this reflected the growth of albums as opposed to singles as rock's main artistic vehicle for expression in the 1960s and 1970s
with a few exceptions commercial freeform had a relatively brief life
with more and more listeners acquiring fm radios the stakes became higher for stations to attract market share so that they could sell more advertising at a higher rate
by 1970 many of the stations were moving to institute programming rules with a clock and system of rotation
with this shift stations formats in the early 1970s were now billed as progressive
djs still had much input over the music they played and the selection was deep and eclectic ranging from folk to hard rock with other styles such as jazz fusion occasionally thrown in
a broad cross section of rock music that gained popularity during this time came to be called progressive rock likely because the wide recognition and success of artists could be attributed to airplay on progressive stations much the way the college rock label was given to bands that received air play on student-run college stations during the 1980s
album oriented radio album oriented rock
later in the decade as program directors began to put more controls over what songs were played on air freeform and progressive stations evolved to the true aor format
album oriented radio rather than single oriented radio or top 40 stations still played longer songs and deep album tracks rather than singles but program directors and consultants took on a greater role in song selection generally limiting airplay to just a few focus tracks from a particular album and concentrating on artists with a more slickly-produced commercial sound than what had been featured a few years earlier
the rock in album-oriented rock came in the late 1970s when aor music libraries and playlists discarded the wide range of genres embraced earlier on to primarily focus on a rock-centric sound
the occasional folk jazz and blues selections became rarer and most black artists were effectively eliminated from airplay
where earlier soul and r b artists like stevie wonder war sly stone and others had been championed by the format aor was no longer representing these styles and took a stance against disco
in 1979 steve dahl of wlup in chicago destroyed disco records on his radio show culminating in a notorious disco demolition at comiskey park
steve slaton of kisw in seattle had a similar on-air bit which was included on the station s epic rock record album
what links the freeform progressive aor and ultimately the classic rock formats are the continuity of rock artists and songs carried through each phase
programmers and djs of the freeform and progressive phases continued to cultivate a repertoire of rock music and style of delivery that were foundations of aor and now classic rock
those aor stations which decided to stay demographically-rooted became classic rock stations by eschewing newer bands which their older listeners might tune out
those that didn't fully evolve into classic rock generally attempt to hold onto their older listeners through careful dayparting playing large amounts of classic rock during the 9 5 workday with more adventurous newer songs baked into the mix as the listener base skews younger at night
michael jackson
in the early 1980s aor radio stations were getting bad press for the lack of black artists included in their programming with the one glaring exception being jimi hendrix indeed many aor stations had embraced harder rock while also cultivating a bad boy image
in 1982 michael jackson released his landmark thriller album which included an eddie van halen guitar solo on the song beat it
facing claims of racism aor stations added beat it to their playlists and the song rose to a respectable 14 on billboard's rock tracks chart which documented aor airplay
curiously for such a strong showing the song has not been widely played on aor or classic rock stations since
the relative success of michael jackson's beat it did not open the floodgates for other black artists on album-oriented rock stations
however the door was cracked and through the remainder of the 1980s jon butcher tracy chapman living colour and lenny kravitz did manage to receive aor airplay of varying magnitude
burkhart abrams
the radio consultants kent burkhart and lee abrams had a huge impact on aor
beginning in the early 70s they began contracting with what would become hundreds of stations by the 1980s
lee abrams had developed a super stars format pioneering it at wqdr in raleigh nc and had been very successful in delivering large ratings
basically abrams took top 40 principles and applied them to aor
while his super stars format was not quite as tight as top 40 radio it was considerably more restricted
this company controlled playlists for a substantial segment aor stations all over the us
this might be considered somewhat ironic considering the format s origins were based on a free-form approach without playlists
lee abrams is now chief programming officer for xm satellite radio
spin-off formats
the phenomenal success of the album-oriented rock and the highly competitive battle for ratings likely contributed to the format splintering to reflect different stylistic perspectives
the 1980s saw some stations adding glam metal bands such as mötley crüe warrant and poison while others embraced new-wave acts such as the cars the fixx inxs and gary myrick
the rise of grunge alternative and hip-hop accelerated the fadeout of the true album-oriented rock format
by the early 1990s most aor radio stations switched exclusively to classic rock or segued to other current formats with somewhat of an aor approach adult album alternative known as triple a echoed a softer aor without the hard rock or heavy metal
for a time seattle's kmtt even promoted freeform fridays and the grey pony tail special to highlight the halcyon days of fm radio
modern rock alternative a pioneer in this format was kroq in la taking the aor programming approach to music with new wave punk college rock and grunge alternative leanings
active rock today s mainstream album rock playing acts such as stone temple pilots foo fighters and linkin park
the active rock format was pioneered by the formerly broadcast now internet only knac-fm out of long beach california in 1986 and expanded upon by wxtb-fm out of tampa florida in january 1990
aor radio stations
the radio stations in the following list were successful with the aor format
in the 1970s and early 1980s some were considered progressive with programing that evolved to what became known as aor
many of these stations have switched from aor to another format in some cases classic rock or one of the other aor spin-offs mentioned above
music played
most radio formats are based on a select tight rotation of hit singles
the best example is top 40 though other formats country smooth jazz and urban all utilize the same basic principles with the most popular songs repeating every 2 to 6 hours depending on their rank in rotation
generally there is a strict order or list to be followed and the dj does not make decisions about what selections are played
aor while still based on the rotation concept focused on the album as a whole rather than singles in the early 1970s many djs had the freedom to chose what track s to play off a given album as well as latitude to decide what order to play the records in
later in the 1970s aor formats became tighter and song selection shifted to the program director or music director rather than the dj
still when an aor station added an album to rotation they would often focus on numerous tracks at once rather than playing the singles as they were individually released
these short lists represent only a sampling of what became staples of american radio through a long history of airplay on album-oriented rock stations
as aor stopped playing new music and died out in the late 1980s the core repertoire of aor became that of the classic rock format
non-single album tracks
with the success of the aor format some non-single album tracks received extensive radio airplay across the us becoming hugely popular most notably led zeppelin s stairway to heaven
other examples of popular songs never released as a 45 rpm record include ac dc for those about to rock we salute you

core artists
this list represents a sampling of artists who achieved their greatest success though airplay on radio stations with the aor format
many of these artists may have crossed over with airplay at top 40 or other formats but the bulk of their airplay was at aor
for example tom petty had just 3 singles between 1977 and 1991 that reached the top ten of the pop singles chart the basis for top 40
